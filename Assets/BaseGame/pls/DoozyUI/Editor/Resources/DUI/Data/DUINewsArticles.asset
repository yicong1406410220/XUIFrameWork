  - title: TouchManager & GestureDetector
    content: 'DoozyUI 2.9 comes with a new module, the TouchManager, that gets created
      automatically when needed, or manually on demand. This manager handles the capture
      of the following gestures: tap, long tap and swipes (on 4 or 8 axis).


      In order to capture and react to a gesture there is a new GestureDetector component
      that can be attached to anything that needs to react to gestures (2D and 3D
      objects).


      This gesture detection implementation is still in its early stages of development
      as we are working on adding more options to it. Should you have any suggestions
      for the TouchManager or the GestureDetector, please let us know.'
  - title: UIDrawer is the first optional module for DoozyUI
    content: 'After a lot of performance and usability tests, the UIDrawer is the
      first optional module for DoozyUI.


      We made sure it works with or without DoozyUI, thus the component can be used
      as a standalone asset as well.


      The UIDrawer is a flexible implementation of a Side Drawer (also known as a
      Navigation Drawer). It can be anchored to any side of the screen and you can
      also use more than one in your UI design (for example, you can have a drawer
      on the left or one on the right, and so on...)

      TouchManager and GestureDetector also come with the UIDrawer component.
